Hi. To get this working, git clone it, run `bin/setup` `bundle && yarn` and then run `foreman start -f Procfile.dev`. 
Navigate to localhost:5000 and see Jimmy Fallons Markov tweets. Scroll
to the bottom and input someone's name to see their markov tweets. There isn't any error
handling right now so make sure to spell their name correctly.
